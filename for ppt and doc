Hereâ€™s a structured documentation for your Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline using BERT. It includes theory, methodology, dataset details, and implementation steps, making it suitable for both technical and business audiences.

Let me know if you need additional sections such as challenges faced, next steps, or business use cases.

ðŸ“„ Document: Named Entity Recognition (NER) using BERT
Prepared by: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
Version: 1.0
ðŸ”· 1. Introduction
1.1 What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, dates, and more.

Example:
Sentence: Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino, California.
Entities Identified:

Apple Inc. â†’ Organization
Cupertino â†’ Location
California â†’ Location
1.2 Why Use BERT for NER?
Traditional NER models rely on rule-based or statistical methods, which may lack contextual understanding. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based deep learning model that improves NER by:
âœ… Understanding the context of words bidirectionally
âœ… Handling ambiguous words better (e.g., "Apple" as a fruit vs. a company)
âœ… Providing state-of-the-art results on NER tasks

ðŸ”· 2. Dataset Overview
2.1 Data Sources
For this project, we use a combination of multiple datasets:

Custom Dataset (Your Files)
tokens_file.csv â†’ Contains sentence_id, token, and tag (NER labels).
sentences_file.csv â†’ Contains sentence_id and description (full sentence).
CoNLL-2003 Dataset (Gold-standard NER dataset)
Includes news articles with PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC entity labels.
N5 Dataset (Another NER dataset)
Provides additional entity labels for improved generalization.
2.2 Data Structure
sentence_id	token	tag	description
1	Apple	B-ORG	Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino.
1	Inc.	I-ORG	Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino.
1	is	O	Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino.
1	headquartered	O	Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino.
ðŸ”· 3. Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for training, we follow these steps:

3.1 Merging Data Sources
Merge tokens_file.csv with sentences_file.csv using sentence_id.
Append CoNLL-2003 and N5 dataset to improve entity coverage.
Fill missing tag values with "O" (Outside entity).
3.2 Label Encoding
Convert entity labels (B-ORG, I-LOC, etc.) into numerical values using Label Encoding.
Example mapping:
python
Copy
Edit
label_to_id = {"O": 0, "B-ORG": 1, "I-ORG": 2, "B-LOC": 3, "I-LOC": 4}
3.3 Grouping Tokens into Sentences
Since NER is a sentence-based task, we group tokens for each sentence_id.
Store tokens and labels as lists for later processing.
ðŸ”· 4. Model Implementation
4.1 Tokenization with BERT
Use the BERT tokenizer to preprocess sentences.
Align tokens with corresponding labels to handle subwords properly.
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertTokenizerFast
tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
4.2 Dataset Preparation
Convert tokenized data into PyTorch dataset format for training.
Use torch.utils.data.Dataset to create a custom dataset class.
4.3 Loading Pretrained BERT Model
Load BertForTokenClassification, a model specifically designed for NER.
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertForTokenClassification
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=5)
ðŸ”· 5. Model Training and Evaluation
5.1 Training Setup
Define training arguments such as batch size, learning rate, and epochs.
Use Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer API to train the model.
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./ner_model",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01
)
5.2 Model Evaluation
Compute precision, recall, and F1-score using sklearn.metrics.classification_report.
Example expected output:
Entity Type	Precision	Recall	F1-score
B-ORG	0.91	0.89	0.90
I-ORG	0.85	0.83	0.84
O	0.98	0.99	0.98
ðŸ”· 6. Model Saving and Deployment
6.1 Saving the Model
python
Copy
Edit
model.save_pretrained("./ner_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./ner_model")
6.2 Loading the Trained Model for Inference
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertForTokenClassification, BertTokenizerFast

loaded_model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("./ner_model")
loaded_tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("./ner_model")
ðŸ”· 7. Results & Observations
The model successfully identified entities from different datasets.
F1-score improved after adding CoNLL-2003 and N5 datasets.
Misclassifications were observed in rare entity types.
ðŸ”· 8. Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Fine-tune with more labeled data to improve rare entity detection.
ðŸ”¹ Use CRF layer on top of BERT to enhance entity boundary predictions.
ðŸ”¹ Optimize model for faster inference using model quantization.

ðŸ”· 9. Conclusion
This document presents a complete end-to-end pipeline for training an NER model using BERT. By combining multiple datasets (custom data, CoNLL-2003, and N5), we improved the modelâ€™s ability to generalize across different domains. The model achieved high accuracy in recognizing named entities and can be further improved with additional training and fine-tuning techniques.
