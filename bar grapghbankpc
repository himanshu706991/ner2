Here’s the Python code to generate Quarterly Losses (Bar Chart) and Event Count Trend (Line Chart) using your dataset.

📜 Python Code: Quarterly Losses & Event Count Trend
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# ✅ Sample Data
data = {
    "Date": pd.date_range(start="2021-01-01", periods=100, freq="D"),
    "Business_Line": ["Bank"] * 50 + ["PC"] * 50,
    "Net_Loss": [abs(x) for x in (100000 * np.random.randn(100)).tolist()],
    "Event_Counts": [abs(int(x)) for x in (10 + 5 * np.random.randn(100)).tolist()],
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"])

# ✅ Group by Business Line & Quarterly Aggregation
df["Quarter"] = df["Date"].dt.to_period("Q")

df_quarterly = df.groupby(["Quarter", "Business_Line"]).agg({
    "Net_Loss": "sum",
    "Event_Counts": "sum"
}).reset_index()

# 🎯 **Graph 1: Quarterly Net Losses (Bar Chart)**
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.barplot(data=df_quarterly, x="Quarter", y="Net_Loss", hue="Business_Line", palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Quarterly Net Losses by Business Line")
plt.xlabel("Quarter")
plt.ylabel("Total Net Loss ($)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid()
plt.legend(title="Business Line")
plt.show()

# 🎯 **Graph 2: Event Count Trend (Line Chart)**
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.lineplot(data=df_quarterly, x="Quarter", y="Event_Counts", hue="Business_Line", marker="o")
plt.title("Event Count Trend Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Quarter")
plt.ylabel("Total Event Count")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid()
plt.legend(title="Business Line")
plt.show()
📌 Explanation of Graphs
1️⃣ Quarterly Losses (Bar Chart) → Compares Bank vs. P&C losses per quarter.
2️⃣ Event Count Trend (Line Chart) → Shows how event frequency changes over time for each business line.

Since I can't run code directly on my end, I’ll describe the expected output visuals for the two graphs:

📊 Graph 1: Quarterly Net Losses (Bar Chart)
✅ X-axis: Quarters (e.g., 2021-Q1, 2021-Q2, ... 2024-Q4)
✅ Y-axis: Total Net Loss ($) per quarter
✅ Bars:

Blue bars → Bank losses
Red bars → P&C losses
✅ Insights:
If Bank has consistently higher losses, the blue bars will be taller.
If P&C has high volatility, its bars may fluctuate significantly.
📈 Graph 2: Event Count Trend (Line Chart)
✅ X-axis: Quarters (e.g., 2021-Q1, 2021-Q2, ... 2024-Q4)
✅ Y-axis: Total Event Count per quarter
✅ Lines:

Orange line → Bank events trend
Green line → P&C events trend
✅ Insights:
Bank event counts might be higher and more stable over time.
P&C events may show spikes due to rare, extreme events.
